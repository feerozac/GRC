# Agentic GRC what is the offering

## Executive Summary

Evonix Agentic GRC is an AI-native Governance, Risk, and Compliance platform designed for regulated organizations that need faster, auditable decision-making. It combines core GRC operations (risk, controls, issues, evidence) with autonomous-but-governed AI agents, virtual three lines of defence (3LOD), and regulator-ready explainability.

The offering is positioned as a system of action, not just a reporting dashboard: agents help detect gaps, generate recommendations, support cyber response, and produce evidence by default while keeping humans accountable through confidence routing, challenge workflows, and immutable audit trails.

## What the Product Offers

### 1) Unified GRC Operating Layer
- Central risk register linked to controls, issues, and evidence.
- Multi-framework control mapping (ISO, NIST, COBIT, HKMA, MAS, PCI DSS, extensible).
- Evidence lifecycle support with retrieval, linkage, and auditability.
- End-to-end issue and remediation tracking with ownership and due dates.

### 2) Agentic Intelligence Layer
- AI executive narratives for board and committee reporting.
- AI gap analysis for new/updated regulations and framework changes.
- Regulatory development monitoring with near real-time ingestion/alerts.
- Org chart + process/control ownership mapping suggestions.
- Document intelligence from annual reports and strategy documents to suggest governance issues.
- KCI/KRI/KPI reasoning with strategy, regulatory, and benchmark-informed priority recommendations.

### 3) Governance, Explainability, and Assurance Layer
- Virtual 3LOD workflows and role-based views (1L/2L/3L).
- 6-layer explainability framework (per-decision rationale, confidence, challenge, regulator reports, monitoring).
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints and escalation for high-risk actions.
- Tamper-evident audit trail (optional blockchain anchoring).
- On-demand Explainability Report + Audit Trail Pack.

### 4) AI Security and Agent Operations Layer
- Dedicated identity per agent (coworker model), no human credential reuse.
- Real-time, context-aware per-action authorization and explicit delegated authority.
- Four-phase skill security pipeline with human approval and "silence = reject".
- Fail-closed operational states (Normal -> Degraded -> Paused -> Stopped).
- Hard API spend caps and loop-detection controls.

### 5) Agentic Cyber Defence Layer
- Detection, Response, Orchestration, and Threat Intel agents.
- CyberAlert/Incident/ResponseAction model linked directly to GRC risks and controls.
- HITL approval for critical/high-severity actions.
- Explainable, auditable cyber decisions with rationale and confidence.

## Product Spec at a Glance (Current Direction)

- **Scope focus (v1):** Core GRC + explainability foundation + agent IAM/security + HKMA/MAS regulatory ingestion + virtual 3LOD.
- **Success intent:** Material reduction in board-pack prep time and audit evidence effort, with improved regulatory responsiveness.
- **Design principle:** "AI assists, humans remain accountable."
- **Rollout discipline:** Adoption Readiness Gate across Governance, Security, Operational, and Assurance checks before regulated-client rollout.

## Competitor Landscape (2026 Snapshot)

### Where incumbents are strong
- Large installed bases and deep enterprise ecosystems (ServiceNow, Archer, IBM).
- Broad integrations and wider regulatory library coverage (e.g., Archer/Credo strengths).
- Strong model-governance tooling (IBM watsonx.governance, Credo AI, Holistic AI).

### Where many competitors are still weak (for GRC operations)
- Limited per-decision explainability at output level.
- Few publish confidence-scored routing tied to role-based review.
- Limited auditable challenge-and-resolution workflows for AI outputs.
- Fragmented linkage between cyber response events and GRC governance artifacts.

### Closest strategic watch
- Hyperproof (early-access AI positioning with HITL/explainability claims) appears closest in narrative; differentiation depends on execution depth, not messaging.

## Challenges to Win

1. **Execution depth vs breadth:** avoid shipping too many differentiators shallowly.
2. **Regulatory mapping quality:** ingestion speed is not enough; mapping accuracy must be trusted.
3. **Operational friction risk:** SOC and 2L workflows must stay fast, not approval-heavy.
4. **Agent IAM complexity:** security model must be enforceable and observable in production.
5. **Performance overhead:** explainability/audit generation must not degrade core UX.
6. **Integration drag:** value must appear early even before full SIEM/HR/document integrations.
7. **Market trust gap:** pre-market platform must prove reliability and governance rigor quickly.

## Core MOAT Thesis

The moat is not "using AI"; it is governed, regulator-ready agentic execution at decision level.

### MOAT pillars
- **Per-decision explainability depth** (rationale, sources, confidence, framework references).
- **Structured challenge mechanism** with auditable human dissent and resolution trail.
- **Evidence-by-design operating model** (compliance artifacts produced during normal operation).
- **Agent IAM and fail-closed controls** purpose-built for autonomous enterprise agents.
- **Cyber-to-GRC linkage** connecting security response activity directly to governance assurance.
- **3LOD-native workflows** that mirror how regulated organizations are actually supervised.

### How to protect the MOAT
- Productize regulator packet quality gates in SDLC, not slideware.
- Publish and standardize the explainability framework externally (thought leadership + trust).
- Prioritize high-precision early use cases over broad but low-trust automation.
- Keep adoption barriers low with templates/sample data while integrations mature.

## Why Buyers Should Care

- Faster, more consistent governance decisions without losing control.
- Better regulator and auditor confidence due to replayable, explainable evidence.
- Reduced manual workload in reporting, mapping, and remediation coordination.
- Improved alignment between board intent, operational controls, and measurable risk outcomes.

## One-line Positioning

Evonix is an AI-native, explainable, and security-governed Agentic GRC platform that turns fragmented compliance work into auditable, continuous governance execution across 1L, 2L, and 3L.
