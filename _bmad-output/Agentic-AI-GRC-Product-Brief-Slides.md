# Agentic AI GRC Platform
## Product Brief Summary

**Project:** agent-grc · **Author:** Mark · **Date:** 2026-01-29

---

# Vision

- AI-native **Governance, Risk & Compliance** platform: single source of truth for controls, risks, evidence
- **Virtual 3 lines of defence (3LOD)** built in
- **Real-time / near real-time** regulatory development (HKMA, MAS, others)
- **Review of NIST, ISO, COBIT** frameworks; org chart & process-to-org mapping
- **Annual reports & strategy** → governance issues (COBIT, COSO)
- **KCI, KRI, KPI** module linked to governance, process, regulatory, policies/standards; gap & metric suggestions
- **AI agents:** narratives, gap analysis, evidence mapping, KCI/KRI/KPI discussion & **priority recommendations** (strategy, regulatory, industry benchmarks)

---

# Problem

- Fragmented risk registers, control libraries, issue trackers, evidence across spreadsheets and point tools
- Multi-framework mapping (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, COBIT, HKMA, MAS) **manual and brittle**
- Regulatory requirements (HKMA, MAS) often **discovered late**; framework updates not systematically reviewed
- **3LOD work in silos**; challenge and assurance inconsistent and hard to evidence
- Process/control ownership **misaligned to org**; governance issues identified **ad hoc**
- KCI/KRI/KPI **siloed**; weak linkage; no strategy/benchmark-driven prioritisation

---

# Solution — Key Capabilities

- **Risk register** + **Control library** (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, COBIT, HKMA, MAS)
- **Real-time regulatory development**; **Framework review** (NIST, ISO, COBIT)
- **Issue & remediation tracking**; **AI executive narratives**; **AI gap analysis**
- **Evidence mapping**; **Org chart** reading & **process-to-org** mapping
- **Annual report & strategy** → governance issues (COBIT, COSO)
- **KCI/KRI/KPI module:** linkage to governance, process, regulatory, policies/standards; **gap & metric suggestions**; **agent priority recommendations**
- **Virtual 3LOD:** line-specific views, challenge flow, reporting

# Value Proposition

| Stakeholder | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| **CISO / Head of Risk** | One place for risk, controls, issues; AI narratives; 2L oversight; org-aligned ownership; KCI/KRI/KPI priorities |
| **Compliance / Audit** | Multi-framework view; 3LOD; org-driven mapping; KCI/KRI/KPI with gap/metric suggestions; agent-driven priorities |
| **Regulated firms (HKMA/MAS)** | Framework views; real-time regulatory updates; AI gap analysis; 3LOD evidence |
| **Executives / Board** | Clear narratives; 1L/2L/3L alignment; governance from strategy (COBIT/COSO); KCI/KRI/KPI priorities from strategy & benchmarks |

---

# Differentiators

- **Agentic AI** — proactive narratives, gap analysis, evidence mapping
- **Virtual 3LOD** — first-class 1L/2L/3L model
- **Multi-framework by design** (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, COBIT, HKMA, MAS); framework review
- **Real-time regulatory intelligence** (HKMA, MAS)
- **Evidence-centric**; **Org-driven mapping**; **Document-driven governance** (annual reports, strategy → COBIT/COSO)
- **KCI/KRI/KPI with agent-driven priorities** (strategy, regulatory, benchmarks)

---

# Virtual 3LOD in the Product

- **First line (1L):** My controls, evidence, issues, attestations
- **Second line (2L):** Risk & control oversight; challenge status; framework coverage; **KCI/KRI/KPI and priorities**; open issues across 1L
- **Third line (3L):** Audit plan; control testing; findings; assurance opinion
- Visibility and workflows **scoped by line** (and entity); separation clear for regulators and board

---

# Primary Personas

- **Priya, CISO (2L):** Risk posture; board/regulator reporting; challenge 1L
- **Marcus, Compliance (2L):** Control library; framework mappings; org-aligned ownership; governance issues (COBIT/COSO); audits
- **Sam, Risk Analyst (2L):** Risk register; KRIs/KCIs/KPIs; agent priorities; risk reports
- **Jordan, Internal Auditor (3L):** Control testing; evidence; findings; assurance; governance vs COBIT/COSO
- **Alex, Executive / Board:** Plain-language risk & compliance; 1L/2L/3L alignment; governance from strategy
- **Secondary:** Regulatory Affairs (2L); Control Owner (1L)

---

# Top Use Cases (1–6)

1. **Unified risk and control view** (filter by framework, entity, owner)
2. **AI executive narrative** for board/committee
3. **AI gap analysis** for new/updated regulation (incl. real-time regulatory feed)
4. **Evidence mapping and retrieval**
5. **End-to-end issue and remediation tracking**
6. **Virtual 3LOD:** line-specific views and challenge flow

---

# Top Use Cases (7–11)

7. **Real-time regulatory development** (HKMA, others)
8. **Framework review** (NIST, ISO, COBIT)
9. **Org chart reading and process-to-org mapping**
10. **Annual report and strategy** → governance issues (COBIT, COSO)
11. **KCI/KRI/KPI module:** linkage; gap & metric suggestions; **agent discussion & priority recommendations** (strategy, regulatory, industry benchmarks)

---

# Non-Functional Requirements (Summary)

- **Performance:** 10K risks, 5K controls, 20K issues (< 3 s p95); narrative < 60 s; gap analysis < 5 min
- **Regulatory:** Real-time/near real-time regulatory ingestion (e.g. 24 h); NIST/ISO/COBIT review; org chart & process-to-org; annual report/strategy → governance; KCI/KRI/KPI module with agent priorities
- **Security:** Encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256); RBAC by line of defence; 7-year tamper-evident audit log
- **Availability:** 99.5%; RPO ≤ 24 h, RTO ≤ 4 h
- **Usability:** Modern browsers; WCAG 2.1 AA for core journeys
- **AI:** Reviewable/versioned narratives; auditable gap analysis & evidence mapping; 3LOD views & reporting; APIs; extensible frameworks
