# How to Improve the Product Vision

**Context:** The Agentic AI GRC product brief is strong on features and differentiators. These suggestions sharpen **clarity**, **focus**, **outcomes**, and **positioning** so the vision is easier to communicate and use for decisions.

---

## 1. Add a One-Line North Star

**Issue:** The vision is a long paragraph. Executives and investors need a single, memorable line.

**Suggestion:** Add a **vision statement** (one sentence) at the top, then keep the rest as “how we get there.”

**Example:**

> **North star:** *“The one place where risk, control, and compliance become a single source of truth—with AI agents and clear 3LOD so teams spend time on decisions, not manual GRC.”*

Or, more outcome-focused:

> **North star:** *“Board-ready risk and compliance narratives in hours, not weeks—from one platform, with 3LOD and AI agents that prioritise what matters.”*

**Action:** Pick one north star and put it above the current vision paragraph. Use the paragraph as the “expanded vision” or “strategic pillars.”

---

## 2. Define Success Outcomes (So That…)

**Issue:** The vision describes *what* the platform does but not *what changes for the customer* in concrete terms.

**Suggestion:** Add 3–5 **outcome statements** in “so that…” form.

**Examples:**

- So that **board and committee packs** are generated in hours, not weeks, and stay consistent and up to date.
- So that **new or updated regulation (e.g. HKMA, MAS)** is reflected in the platform within 24 hours and gap analysis is one click away.
- So that **1L, 2L, and 3L** see one version of the truth with line-specific views and demonstrable challenge flow for regulators.
- So that **ownership of controls and processes** follows the real org structure, with suggestions when the org chart changes.
- So that **governance issues** are suggested from strategy and annual reports and tied to COBIT/COSO, not only from audits.

**Action:** Add a short “Vision outcomes” subsection (bullets or 1–2 sentences each). Use these in sales, roadmap, and success metrics.

---

## 3. Sharpen Target Segment and Geography

**Issue:** “Organisations” is broad. The brief already leans APAC (HKMA, MAS) and regulated firms—making that explicit strengthens positioning.

**Suggestion:** Add **target segment** and **primary geography** to the vision section.

**Example:**

- **Primary segment:** Regulated financial services (banks, insurers, asset managers) and large enterprises with mature 2L/3L and multi-framework compliance.
- **Primary geography:** APAC (Hong Kong, Singapore, and expandable), with HKMA and MAS as first-class regulatory sources.
- **Secondary:** Global firms with APAC entities or multi-jurisdiction compliance who want one platform and near real-time regulatory intelligence.

**Action:** Add 2–3 sentences under “Who we serve” or “Target segment” in the one-pager. Use this to prioritise features (e.g. HKMA/MAS, 3LOD evidence for regulators).

---

## 4. Prioritise Differentiators (Tier 1 vs Tier 2)

**Issue:** Eight differentiators are listed with equal weight. That makes messaging and roadmap trade-offs harder.

**Suggestion:** Split into **Tier 1** (must-have for positioning) and **Tier 2** (important but not the headline).

**Example:**

- **Tier 1 (headline differentiators):**
  - Agentic AI (narratives, gap analysis, evidence, KCI/KRI/KPI discussion and priorities).
  - Virtual 3LOD (first-class 1L/2L/3L views, challenge flow, reporting).
  - Org-driven mapping (org chart → process/control ownership).
  - Document-driven governance (annual report/strategy → governance issues with COBIT/COSO).
  - Near real-time APAC regulatory intelligence (HKMA, MAS) feeding gap analysis.

- **Tier 2 (table stakes or supporting):**
  - Multi-framework by design (ISO, NIST, COBIT, HKMA, MAS) and framework review.
  - Evidence-centric (mapping, AI suggestions).
  - KCI/KRI/KPI module with gap/metric suggestions and agent priorities (could be Tier 1 if you lead with “metrics that matter”).

**Action:** In the brief, label or order differentiators by tier. Use Tier 1 in elevator pitch and investor/board slides.

---

## 5. Add “Why Now” and Market Timing

**Issue:** The vision doesn’t say why this is the right moment for the market or the product.

**Suggestion:** Add a short **Why now** line or paragraph.

**Example:**

- Regulators (HKMA, MAS) are pushing regtech and faster response to regulatory change.
- Boards and regulators expect clearer 3LOD evidence and consistent narratives.
- AI (including agents) is moving from “assist” to “orchestrate” in GRC; early movers (Trustero, Hyperproof, AuditBoard) are setting expectations.
- Fragmentation (e.g. 92% use 3+ tools for evidence) creates demand for a single source of truth and agentic workflows.

**Action:** Add 2–4 bullets or one short paragraph under “Why now” in the one-pager. Use in pitch and strategy docs.

---

## 6. Make “Out of Scope” or Constraints Explicit

**Issue:** Saying what the product is *not* (or not yet) sharpens focus and sets expectations.

**Suggestion:** Add a short **Out of scope / constraints** subsection (can be internal-only).

**Examples:**

- Not a replacement for core banking or trading systems; we integrate.
- Not a legal or regulatory advice engine; we surface requirements and gaps; interpretation stays with the firm.
- First release may not cover all regulators globally; APAC (HKMA, MAS) first, then expand.
- Agent recommendations are advisory; final decisions remain with 2L/board.

**Action:** Add 3–5 bullets under “Out of scope” or “Constraints.” Reduces scope creep and clarifies positioning.

---

## 7. Tie Vision to the Market Comparison

**Issue:** The GRC market comparison identifies gaps and differentiators but isn’t referenced in the vision.

**Suggestion:** In the vision section, add one sentence that references competitive positioning.

**Example:**

- *“We focus on capabilities that incumbents under-serve: org-driven and document-driven governance, near real-time APAC regulatory intelligence, first-class 3LOD, and KCI/KRI/KPI agents that use strategy and benchmarks to prioritise.”*

**Action:** Add one “Positioning” or “Competitive focus” sentence to the one-pager, and point to the full comparison doc for detail.

---

## 8. Optional: Phased Vision (Now / Next / Later)

**Issue:** Everything in the vision sounds simultaneous. A simple time view helps roadmap and funding discussions.

**Suggestion:** Add a **phased vision** (high level, not a full roadmap).

**Example:**

- **Phase 1 (foundation):** Single source of truth (risk, control, issue, evidence); multi-framework library (ISO, NIST, COBIT, HKMA, MAS); virtual 3LOD views and workflows; AI executive narratives and gap analysis.
- **Phase 2 (intelligence):** Near real-time regulatory ingestion (HKMA, MAS); framework review; org chart and process-to-org mapping; KCI/KRI/KPI module with gap/metric suggestions.
- **Phase 3 (agentic):** Document-driven governance (annual report/strategy → COBIT/COSO issues); agent discussion and priority recommendations (strategy, regulatory, benchmarks); full agentic orchestration.

**Action:** Either add a short “Strategic phases” subsection or keep this in a separate roadmap doc and reference “see roadmap” from the vision.

---

## 9. Improve Scannability of the Vision Paragraph

**Issue:** The current vision is one dense paragraph. Hard to scan and remember.

**Suggestion:** Keep one short **vision sentence** (north star), then break the rest into **3–5 pillars** or bullets.

**Example structure:**

1. **Single source of truth** — Risk, control, issue, evidence in one platform; multi-framework (ISO, NIST, COBIT, HKMA, MAS); 3LOD built in.
2. **Regulatory intelligence** — Near real-time HKMA/MAS (and others); framework review (NIST, ISO, COBIT); AI gap analysis fed by regulatory feed.
3. **Org and document-driven** — Org chart → process/control mapping; annual report/strategy → governance issues (COBIT, COSO).
4. **KCI/KRI/KPI and agents** — Indicators linked to governance, process, regulatory, policies; gap/metric suggestions; agents discuss and prioritise using strategy, regulatory, benchmarks.
5. **Agentic AI** — Narratives, gap analysis, evidence mapping, and priorities orchestrated by AI agents so work is decision-focused, not manual.

**Action:** Replace or supplement the long paragraph with this structure (or similar). Use the same pillars in the PowerPoint and pitch.

---

## 10. Add a Short “Risks to the Vision” or Assumptions

**Issue:** Vision documents rarely state what must be true for the vision to hold.

**Suggestion:** Add 3–5 **assumptions** or **risks to the vision** (internal or external).

**Examples:**

- Regulators (HKMA, MAS) continue to publish machine-readable or scrapeable content so near real-time ingestion is feasible.
- Buyers accept “AI-suggested” outputs as long as they are reviewable, editable, and auditable (we already reflect this in NFRs).
- Organisations are willing to consolidate GRC onto one platform if 3LOD, frameworks, and regulatory intelligence are strong enough.
- Org chart and document ingestion (HR/identity, strategy docs) are technically and contractually feasible (APIs, consent, security).

**Action:** Add a short “Assumptions” or “Risks to the vision” subsection (can be in an appendix). Use in strategy and risk reviews.
