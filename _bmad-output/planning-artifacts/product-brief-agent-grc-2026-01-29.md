# Product Brief: agent-grc

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary

Agentic AI GRC is an enterprise governance, risk, and compliance platform built to eliminate the manual, time‑intensive work of remediation, compliance, regulatory approvals, control testing, and risk identification. It embeds AI agents with distinct personas aligned to the three lines of defence (1L/2L/3L) so governance stays fully engaged while repetitive work is automated. The result is faster decision cycles, audit‑ready outcomes, and regulator‑friendly accountability without sacrificing human oversight.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Managing remediation, compliance, regulatory approvals, control testing, risk identification, and strategy linkage is labor‑intensive and fragmented. Risk and compliance teams are highly specialised and costly, yet still spend too much time on coordination rather than reducing risk.

### Problem Impact

Audit preparation remains slow and reactive, regulatory change outpaces reporting cycles, and accountability is hard to evidence. This increases operational risk, audit pressure, and compliance cost.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Traditional GRC tools organise workflows but do not operate governance continuously. They automate tasks but cannot provide real‑time governance engagement, explainability at scale, or strategy‑to‑metrics translation without heavy manual effort.

### Proposed Solution

An agentic AI–enabled enterprise GRC platform that automates the work while preserving accountability. Human‑in‑the‑loop checkpoints ensure high‑risk decisions are validated by experts, while AI agents continuously identify risks, accelerate remediation, interpret regulatory change, and map governance decisions back to business strategy. This creates audit‑proof, regulator‑ready outputs without slowing the organisation.

### Key Differentiators

- **Accountability by design:** Humans own high‑risk decisions; AI actions are traceable and auditable.
- **Explainability at scale:** Plain‑language executive narratives plus technical rationale for auditors.
- **Automation without loss of rigor:** Repetitive work automated, assurance strengthened by continuous evidence.
- **Strategy → governance “round‑trip”:** Strategy and board intent translate to objectives, policies, standards, org/process, metrics, and logs.
- **3LOD‑aligned agent personas:** Agents reinforce governance culture rather than bypass it.

## Competitive Analysis

### Evaluation Criteria (Weighted)

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Agentic AI Capability** | 25% | True autonomous agents vs workflow automation |
| **3LOD Native Design** | 20% | First-class 1L/2L/3L separation and workflows |
| **Explainability at Scale** | 15% | Plain-language + technical audit rationale |
| **Strategy-to-Metrics Round-Trip** | 15% | Board intent → objectives → evidence → logs |
| **APAC Regulatory Intelligence** | 10% | HKMA/MAS near real-time coverage |
| **Org/Doc Governance Mapping** | 10% | Org chart + annual report ingestion |
| **Time to Audit-Ready** | 5% | Speed of board pack generation |

### Competitor Scoring (1-5 scale)

| Vendor | Agentic AI (25%) | 3LOD (20%) | Explainability (15%) | Strategy→Metrics (15%) | APAC Reg (10%) | Org/Doc (10%) | Audit Speed (5%) | **Weighted Score** |
|--------|------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Agentic AI GRC (Ours)** | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | **5.00** |
| IBM OpenPages | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | **2.95** |
| ServiceNow GRC | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **2.65** |
| AuditBoard | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 | **2.80** |

### Why Competitors Don't Cover Org/Doc Governance Mapping

| Barrier | Incumbent Challenge | Our Advantage |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Architecture Legacy** | Built 10-15 years ago as structured data systems; retrofitting NLP/ML is expensive | Built agent-first with document intelligence native |
| **Data Model Limitations** | Model Risks → Controls → Evidence only; no strategy-to-metrics lineage | Governance exoskeleton: Strategy → Objectives → Policies → Standards → Org → Process → Metrics → Logs |
| **Customer Expectation Mismatch** | Optimized for "help me pass audits" not "interpret my board papers" | Designed for strategy-to-governance translation |
| **AI Maturity Gap** | Experimenting with LLMs; none shipped org/doc parsing at scale | Production-ready with human-in-the-loop validation |
| **Liability Concerns** | Risk-averse about AI-generated governance recommendations | Explainability by Design + immutable audit trail |

### Primary Differentiators to Lead With

1. **Agentic-native architecture** — not retrofitted AI on legacy workflows
2. **First-class 3LOD** — persona-aligned agents preserving governance culture
3. **Strategy → metrics round-trip** — governance exoskeleton from board to logs
4. **APAC regulatory intelligence** — HKMA/MAS 24h SLA

### Competitive Positioning

Position as the **only agent-first GRC platform** built for continuous governance, not workflow automation with AI bolted on.
